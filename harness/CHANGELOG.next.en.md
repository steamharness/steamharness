# Unreleased

- Added immutable, execution-scoped user settings through `getUserSettings`, `withUserSettings`, and host validation with `parseUserSettings`. Explicit `permissionPolicy: "inherit"` uses the user policy, falling back to `auto` without a host. Omitted policies still default to `workspace`; turn input takes precedence and tools share the resolved scope.
